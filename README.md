it is self-education practice to build a Deep Learning Machine for predictive writing

1: use original writings as training data

in this sample, we use dick_chapters.txt 

2: use python NLP module spacy for preprocessing the text string 

convert text to tokens 

remove punctuation 

prepair traing and target sequences 

3: use python module keras to build and train a deep learning machine of neuron network 

in this sample, we use 1 input layer, 2 hidden layers and 1 output layer 

4: we use a trained deep-learning machine (model) to predict what would be the next words 

after a seed text string. The seed text string can be a randomly selected sentance from 

the original text.
